# Title
The magic of application modeling

# Description

Software changed and became distributed, the operations tools need to keep up.
We need logical models to understand how the software interconnects. When
companies make the decision to "build or buy" software, they almost always
do the operations in house. Great operations knowledge is scarce, and often
closely tied to the environment where it's created. This makes it hard to
share. We need tools that allow us to share the operations knowledge as
easily as we share open source software. Application modeling allows you
to create a logical model of your solution and deploy the same model on
your laptop, as your cloud.
