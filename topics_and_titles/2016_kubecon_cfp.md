### What type of submission is your proposal? 
Presentation

### Which category is your proposal? 
Operations

### Please provide a title for your proposal: 
Modeling Kubernetes clusters

### Please provide your abstract: 
Kubernetes clusters are by nature distributed, and is a complex system to operate. We need logical models to understand how software connects and relates to other applications. When companies make the decision to "build or buy" software, they almost always do the operations in house. Great operations knowledge is scarce, and often tied to the environment where it was created, which makes it hard to share. We need tools that allow us to share the operations knowledge as easily as we share open source software. Application modeling creates a logical representation of your solution. These models deploy using the same open source operations to different clouds including bare metal!

### Select the experience level this content is best suited: 
Beginner

### Benefits to the Ecosystem: 
Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem. We realize that this can be a difficult question to answer, but as with the abstract, the relevance of your presentation is just as important as the content.

The model encapsulates open source operations for the entire life cycle of the application. It allows developers to iterate, share operations, and best practices no matter what cloud they are using. Now they can focus on the deliverable inside Kubernetes and not the operations of turning up a cluster.
